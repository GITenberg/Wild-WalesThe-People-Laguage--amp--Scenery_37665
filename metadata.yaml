description: "Wild Wales: Its People, Language and Scenery is a travel book by the\
  \ English Victorian gentleman writer George Borrow (1803â€“1881), first published\
  \ in 1862.\nThe book recounts Borrow's personal experiences and insights while touring\
  \ Wales alone on foot after a family holiday in Llangollen in 1854, and has come\
  \ to be regarded as a source of useful information about the social and geographical\
  \ history of the country at that time.\nIt has been described as \"robust, dramatic\
  \ and cheerful\", and the author as \"an agreeably eccentric, larger-than-life,\
  \ jovial man whose laughter rings all through the book\".\nThe author makes much\
  \ of his self-taught ability to speak the Welsh language and how surprised the native\
  \ Welsh people he meets and talks to are by both his linguistic abilities and his\
  \ travels, education and personality, and also by his idiosyncratic pronunciation\
  \ of their language.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
